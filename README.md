# Partooth

## What it is

Partooth is a simple application to do bluetooth paring. 
With the aid of the awesome bluez 5 it can scan your surroundings for bluetooth devices, and pair your laptop with them. 

Once you grow weary of a device, Partooth can unpair it for you.

### The name

- Is a contraction of the danish words 'parre bluetooth' which means 'pairing bluetooth'. 

- Sounds a bit like the french word 'partout' which .. err .. is probably not significant.

## What it isn't

Partooth will not offer functionality to actually _use_ your shiny new bluetooth connection. That is left to other applications.

Ie. you

- use your audio system (like pulseaudio or whatever) to direct sound to/from a headset
- use your network management (like connman) to use your smartphone for tethering over bluetooth.
- use your file manager to browse and access files on your bluetooth device.

etc.
